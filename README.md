## Free your vacuum from the cloud

Valetudo aims to be a vendor-agnostic abstraction and cloud replacement for vacuum robots.  

The project started as a standalone binary on rooted roborock vacuums and has since grown to support more vendors, with more to come in the future.

The main goal of Valetudo is to disable all cloud connectivity and instead provide controls via a
**mobile-friendly web interface** as well as **MQTT** connectivity that also supports discovery in **Home Assistant**.

as the docs in general at [https://valetudo.cloud](https://valetudo.cloud)
